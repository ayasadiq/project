       <h2>Internet of things:</h2>
        <div>   The Internet of things (IoT) is the network of devices, vehicles,<br>
         and home appliances that contain electronics, software, actuators,<br>
         and connectivity which allows these things to connect, interact and exchange data.<br>
         IoT involves extending Internet connectivity beyond standard devices, such as desktops, <br>
         laptops, smartphones and tablets, to any range of traditionally <br>
         dumb or non-internet-enabled physical devices and everyday objects.
         Embedded with technology,<br> these devices can communicate and interact over the Internet,<br>
         and they can be remotely monitored and controlled.</div>
       <h2>History of IOT:</h2>
       <div>  Kevin Ashton, co-founder of the Auto-ID Center at MIT, first mentioned the internet <br>
         of things in a presentation he made to Procter & Gamble (P&G) in 1999. Wanting <br>
         bring radio frequency ID (RFID) to the attention of P&G's senior management,<br> 
         Ashton called his presentation "Internet of Things" to incorporate the cool new<br>
         trend of 1999: the internet. MIT professor Neil Gershenfeld's book, When Things<br>
         Start to Think, also appearing in 1999, didn't use the exact term but provided<br>
         a clear vision of where IoT was headed.<br>

         IoT has evolved from the convergence of wireless technologies, microelectromechanical<br>
         systems (MEMS),  The convergence has helped tear down the silos between <br>
         operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT),<br>
         enabling  data to be analyzed for insights to drive improvements.<br>
            
         The first internet appliance, for example, was a Coke machine at Carnegie Mellon University<br>
         in the early 1980s. Using the web, programmers could check the status of the machine and<br>
         determine should they decide to make the trip to the machine.<br>
